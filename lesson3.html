                        <p>Kids need fathers. As our Heavenly Father presides over our eternal spiritual progression, providing tools, guidance, and support to His children, a father presides over his family, imparting on his children the same faculties.</p>
                        <p>As discussed previously, the earthly family mimics the structure of God’s family. However, this alone does not requisite the needed presence of a father in the life of his children.</p>
                        <p>The cultural phenomenon of fatherless homes continues to increase throughout the United States. Although this is an issue in and of itself, it brings along with it a myriad of negative consequences. </p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/FatherWithFamily2.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <p>71% of highschool dropouts, 85% of youth in prison, and 90% of runaway children grow up in homes without a father present. Furthermore, teens that grow up without a father are more likely to experience teen pregnancy, and even have various physical health problems throughout their life.</p>
                        <p>The lives of these children are being forever changed because of the delinquency of their fathers.</p>
                        <p>The most important part of fatherhood is simply being there for your children – not running away when times get difficult, and struggles arise. The success of your children will largely be determined by your presence, or the lack thereof.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Showing Love</h2>
                        <p>Your children need to feel the love that you have for them. “Parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness”. The responsibility to rear your children is simple: you children should hear, feel, and understand your love. Your love needs to be vocalized.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote"> "Brethren and sisters, when was the last time you took your eternal companion in your arms and said, “I love you”? Parents, when was the last time you sincerely expressed love to your children? Children, when was the last time you told your parents that you love them?" - David A. Bednar</blockquote>
                        <p>How sad it must be for a child to grow up in a home where he or she is rarely told by their mother or father that they love them. Your love shouldn’t just be had for yourself, it needs to be expressed, told, and shared. Your children should have no doubt in their mind the love that you have for them.</p>
                        <p>Your children also need to feel the love you have for them</p>
                        <p>An experiment on rabbits conducted in the 70’s showed that rabbits that experienced more love shown to them had better health and fat regulation.</p>
                        <p>There is no real replacement for love. “[Love] will do what money lavished on children will never do.”</p>
                        <p>Do not worry that you may show love differently than your spouse. It is the difference between the two approaches that allow children to develop a full range of social skills.</p>
                        <p>In general, mothers are more likely to “coo and cuddle” their infants, and fathers are more likely to “tickle and toss” them. It is because of these differences, not in spite of them, that children develop a more broad set of social awareness and likability.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">“In repeated studies, fathers who spent more time in positive play with their children had children with the highest peer ratings. When fathers were more responsive, patient, playful, and less coercive in their play, children showed less aggressiveness and more peer competence, and they were better liked.”</blockquote>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Raising Expectations</h2>
                        <p>In conjunction with different methods of showing love, there also tends to be a difference in extending discipline. “Fathers tend to discipline less often than mothers, but when they do, they exhibit more firmness and predictability. Children, in turn, are more likely to comply with their father’s requests and demands than with their mother’s.”</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" Style="float:inline-start;"src="assets/img/FatherTossingHisKid.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">"Joy comes from our posterity, and we rejoice as they are blessed by the ordinances of salvation and exaltation." - President Russel M. Nelson</span>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        <p>These differences are healthy for children, and allow them to experience more variety in their ability to process discipline and experience growth.</p>
                        <p>Remember, however, that there is a difference between discipline and punishment.</p>
                        <p>"’Discipline’ and ‘punishment’ are not synonymous. Punishment suggests hurting, paying someone back for a wrong committed. Discipline implies an action directed toward a goal … of helping the recipient to improve himself. … Discipline should always be with love.”</p>
                        <p>When discipline is shown with love, it changes the method of discipline as well as the intent. Imagine your kid does something wrong to another person. A punishment enacted without love may include physical repercussions such as spanking, a paddle, etc.. However, discipline enacted with love may lean more towards having your child personally apologize to the person they wronged, and encouraging reparations. Although there is no physical discipline, there maintains a level of emotional “repentance” as the child experiences a level of embarrassment and sympathy.</p>
                        <p>Being  an authoritative parent is not negative. By expressing deep and sincere love while also maintaining a high expectation for your children, you enable them to develop a “more upbeat mood, high self-esteem, more self control and cooperativeness”. Additionally, as they grow, they will have more “social and moral maturity and academic achievement.” These attributes are not easily replicated through other means.</p>
