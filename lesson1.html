                        <p>D. Todd Christofferson of the quorum of the twelve taught that “the very reason the earth was created was so families could be formed and sealed to each other.”</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">Why is this so?</blockquote>
                        <p>The Family: A Proclamation to the World states that “Each [human being] is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny.” All of us are literal spirit children of Heavenly Parents. Each of us come from the same spiritual family.</p>
                        <p>However, God’s plan wasn’t for us to remain as spirits. He sent us to earth to obtain bodies, and experience a place of learning and growth. The best place to obtain that growth is within the “laboratory of the family”. A family, in the ideal sense, is structured the same way as our Heavenly family – with a father, mother, and children. This mimicked structure is not out of mere coincidence. </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Why Family?</h2>
                        <p>The family’s goal is “to prepare all members of the family to return to our Heavenly Father.” This is in line with the goal of our Heavenly Father “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.”</p>
                        <p>The earthly family is structured as God’s family, because the earthly family’s purpose is God’s purpose. It’s no wonder that our prophet has taught that exaltation is a family matter. Exaltation cannot occur otherwise. It is through the everlasting covenant of marriage that men and women can one day be like their Heavenly Parents.</p>
                        <p>The family, then, must be a sort of training ground for God’s children to one day become like Him, with countless dominions and principalities. It seems that the family is one of those “few things” we are given stewardship over, so that we may one day be entrusted with “many things” in the vast eternities of the kingdom of our Father.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://www.ivyrehab.com/wp-content/uploads/2028/11/father-encouraging-smiling-baby-daughter-to-take-f-2022-02-02-03-59-03-utc-768x512.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">"For behold, this is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man." - Moses 1:39</span>
                        <p>To be a father becomes more of a calling, foreordained to most of God’s children in the premortal life. It is there that we learned the purpose of our existence, and likely learned about the great calling that awaits us in the mortal realm. The calling of a father begins premortally, takes shape in mortality, and persists through the rest of eternity.</p>
                        <p>This is not something to be shrugged off while in this life. </p>
                        <p>Perhaps it is even life itself. </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What, then?</h2>
                        <p>The rate of absentee fathers continues to increase throughout the United States. Millions of children in the United States live in homes without fathers – about 1 in four.</p>
                        <p>Although children of unwed parents growing up in fatherless homes is a rising cultural phenomenon, it does not comprise the view of our Heavenly Father. We must allow our children the opportunity to grow up in a home where they may have all of the privileges and blessings that they may be allotted. Our children are “entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony, and to be reared by a father and a mother who honor marital vows with complete fidelity.”</p>
                        <p>The shift back to God’s vision of the family begins with you and I as fathers in the Church of Jesus Christ, and it starts today.</p>
