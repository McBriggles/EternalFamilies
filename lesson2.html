                       <p>“Those who are married should consider their union as their most cherished earthly relationship.” Marriage takes on a new level of importance and respect when viewed through a lens of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.Marriage moves from something that many people just do when they find someone they like, to the most important relationship someone can create in this life. From a burden or “ball and chain” to an opportunity for growth and progression. See, without marriage, for Latter-Day Saints, life begins to lose it’s meaning.</p>
                       <p>In this section, I don’t plan on discussing how to find “the one”, but rather how to navigate life once a decision is made. There are very few one-size-fits-all principles when it comes to searching for an eternal companion. However, there is much to discuss in regards to a married relationship that we will discuss here.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Working Together</h2>
                        <p>When Adam and Eve were removed from the Garden of Eden they embarked into a lifetime of trial and struggle as Adam would “eat bread by the sweat of [his] brow”. In the Moses account as recorded in the Pearl of Great Price, however, “Eve, also, his wife, did labor with him”. This effort to be successful in this life was no individual endeavor.</p>
                        <p>This was no one-time exception. “Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh”. To be one flesh means much more to live in the same home, wear rings to signify union, or even to just see each other every day. This means a whole and complete union of hearts and minds, united eternally to the same goal.</p>
                        <p>“Marriage, in its truest sense, is a partnership of equals, with neither person exercising dominion over the other, but with each encouraging, comforting, and helping the other.”</p>
                        <p>In any endeavor, neither the mother or the father is to be greater than the other. Although roles may be different, There should never be a sense of inequality between a husband and a wife. It is only through this perfect union that true marital happiness is capable of being achieved.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Communication</h2>
                        <p>If our marriage is meant to be considered our most important and cherished earthly relationship, then our communication towards our spouse should be open, thought-out, and honest. Only communication with the utmost respect should be tolerated in marriage.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote"> “Christlike communications are expressed in tones of love rather than loudness. They are intended to be helpful rather than hurtful. They tend to bind us together rather than to drive us apart. They tend to build rather than to belittle"</blockquote>

                        <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>
                        <p>The most important type of communication is that of love. Your wife should know without any doubt in their mind that you love them with all your heart, might, mind and strength. This should be the most frequent form of communication that you have with your spouse. Even when discussing other topics and subjects, they should always be conducted with love and appreciation for your eternal companion.</p>
